# ChallengeSSTIC2015

Link to the challenge: http://communaute.sstic.org/ChallengeSSTIC2015
The goal was to find an email address in: http://static.sstic.org/challenge2015/challenge.zip

Here is my solution to the SSTIC Challenge 2015: http://static.sstic.org/challenge2015/solutions/erwan_hamon.pdf

You'll find a lot of very good, funny, hairy solutions on the SSTIC website. Mostly in French.

Mine is in (fr)english and I guess it's the main good thing about it...
